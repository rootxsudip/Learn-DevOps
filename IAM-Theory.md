### IAM (Identity and Access Management) in AWS
"IAM" in AWS stands for Identity and Access Management. It's a service that allows you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. IAM enables you to create and manage users, groups, and roles, and assign permissions to them to control who can access which resources and perform which actions within your AWS environment. With IAM, you can enforce security policies, set up multi-factor authentication, and integrate with other AWS services for enhanced security and compliance.

#### In AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management), there are several types of user accounts that you can create and manage:

**IAM Users:** These are the individuals within your organization who will be accessing your AWS resources. Each IAM user has unique security credentials (username and password or access keys) and permissions.  
* Only 5k Users can be created in an organization and it can be increased by contacting support.

**IAM Groups:** Groups are collections of IAM users. You can assign permissions to groups rather than individual users, which makes managing permissions easier, especially in larger organizations where users may have similar roles and responsibilities.  

**IAM Roles:** Roles are similar to users, but they are not associated with a specific person. Instead, roles are meant to be assumed by entities such as AWS services, applications, or users from another AWS account (cross-account roles). Roles define a set of permissions that the entity can assume when it is temporarily "assumed" by a user or service.  

**AWS Account Root User:** This is the user created when you first create your AWS account. The root user has complete access to all AWS services and resources within the account. However, it's recommended to create IAM users with appropriate permissions and use them instead of relying on the root user for day-to-day activities, as the root user has unrestricted access.  

Each of these user types serves a specific purpose in managing access to AWS resources and implementing security best practices within your AWS environment.  

#### Policies in AWS:
In AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management), a policy is a JSON document that defines permissions. Policies are used to specify who has access to AWS resources and what actions they can perform on those resources. Policies can be attached to IAM users, groups, and roles to grant or restrict permissions.

There are two main types of policies in AWS IAM:

**Managed Policies:** These are standalone policies that you can attach to multiple users, groups, or roles within your AWS account. Managed policies can be either AWS managed (created and managed by AWS) or customer managed (created and managed by you). AWS managed policies are predefined policies created and maintained by AWS, covering common use cases such as read-only access, full access to specific services, etc. Customer managed policies are custom policies that you create to define specific permissions tailored to your organization's needs.  

**Inline Policies:** These are policies that are directly embedded within an IAM user, group, or role. Inline policies are specific to the entity to which they are attached and cannot be reused across multiple entities. Inline policies are useful when you need to create policies that are closely tied to a specific user, group, or role.  

AWS Policy Types in documention: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#access_policy-types

In AWS IAM, policies are represented in JSON format. Below is an example of how a JSON policy might look:
```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/uploaded/*",
      "Condition": {
        "IpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": "203.0.113.0/24"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/secret/*",
      "Condition": {
        "Bool": {
          "aws:SecureTransport": "false"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```
Let's break down this policy:

"Version": Indicates the IAM policy language version. In this example, it's set to "2012-10-17", which is the current version.

"Statement": An array containing one or more policy statements. Each statement defines a set of permissions.

"Effect": Specifies whether the statement allows or denies access. It can have values "Allow" or "Deny".

"Action": Defines the AWS actions allowed or denied by the statement. It can specify single or multiple actions using an array.

"Resource": Specifies the AWS resources to which the actions apply. It can be a single resource or a wildcard pattern (*) to match multiple resources.

"Condition": Optional field that specifies conditions under which the statement is enforced. Conditions are based on attributes of the request, such as the IP address of the requester, the time of day, or the presence of encryption.

This example policy allows:
Reading objects from the "example-bucket".
Uploading and deleting objects from the "uploaded" folder within "example-bucket" if the request originates from the IP range 203.0.113.0/24.
Denies all actions on objects within the "secret" folder of "example-bucket" if the request is not made over a secure connection.

#### Best practices in AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) which helps to ensure security, manageability, and compliance within the AWS environment.
Here are some key best practices:

**Use IAM Roles:** Instead of relying on long-term access keys, use IAM roles for granting permissions to AWS resources. Roles provide temporary credentials with limited permissions and are preferred for applications running on EC2 instances, Lambda functions, or for cross-account access.

**Implement the Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the permissions necessary for users, groups, and roles to perform their required tasks. Avoid granting excessive permissions, and regularly review and refine permissions based on job roles and responsibilities.

**Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Require IAM users to use MFA for accessing the AWS Management Console, API calls, or when performing sensitive actions. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of verification, such as a time-based one-time password generated by a hardware token or mobile app.

**Regularly Rotate Access Keys and Credentials:** Rotate access keys, passwords, and other credentials regularly to minimize the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised or leaked credentials. AWS provides tools and APIs for managing and automating the rotation process.

**Monitor and Audit IAM Access:** Use AWS CloudTrail to monitor and log IAM actions, including user sign-ins, changes to IAM policies, and API calls. Regularly review and analyze these logs for suspicious activities, unauthorized access attempts, or policy changes.

**Use IAM Policies Effectively:** Craft IAM policies carefully, following the principle of least privilege. Utilize AWS managed policies when possible and create custom policies tailored to specific roles and resources. Leverage conditions in policies to enforce additional security requirements, such as IP restrictions or requiring the use of SSL/TLS.

**Regularly Review IAM Permissions:** Periodically review IAM permissions to ensure they align with business requirements and follow the principle of least privilege. Remove unnecessary permissions, decommission unused IAM users and roles, and update permissions as job roles change.

**Secure Root Account and Secure Keys:** Secure the root AWS account with a strong password and enable MFA to prevent unauthorized access. Avoid using root account credentials for day-to-day activities. Securely manage access keys, encrypt them at rest, and avoid hardcoding them in code or configuration files.

**Enable Access Advisor and Trusted Advisor:** Use IAM Access Advisor to review the permissions granted to IAM users, roles, and groups. Utilize AWS Trusted Advisor to receive recommendations for optimizing IAM configurations and enhancing security posture.

Educate Users on IAM Best Practices: Provide training and guidance to IAM users on security best practices, including password hygiene, MFA usage, and the importance of safeguarding access keys and credentials.
